#+title:Shell Globals
In an attempt to stay sane and have similar enough configs across the various computers I use this is intended to be a general top level list of generic aliases and functions.

* Quick Setup
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       f8415b88-7fdb-4bb2-839f-251d36d3a93d
:END:
For use on a server or something where I just want to be able to feel at home

#+begin_src shell
git clone https://github.com/andanao/dotfiles/tree/main
. ./shell_global/general.sh
#+end_src


Oneliner:
#+begin_src shell
git clone https://github.com/andanao/dotfiles/tree/main && . ./shell_global/general.sh
#+end_src
* Common Syntax
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       331475d2-2501-4554-b736-6d7889565a9d
:END:
Within [[aliases.sh][aliases.sh]] for common directories, or command I use the prefix ~jk~ to indicate commands that are frequently used.  The infrequent use of ~jk~ and placement on the home row make it a wonderful leader combination for commands.
** Setting Variables
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       b96ec115-bace-4e8a-86e1-ff407bf78397
:END:
Often (and unfortuantely) common directories aren't where I might expect them (~~/git~ most commonly) so these are a list of variables where I can explicitly set paths to directories I commonly need to get to

#+begin_src shell
git_dir = "/path/to/git/directory"
org_dir = "/path/to/org/directory"
emacs_dir = "/path/to/emacs/directory"
conf_dir = "/path/to/config/directory"
#+end_src

** Common Directories and Variables
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       1a44ba1a-1252-4249-a47b-e05bc8e15a76
:END:
I've found one of the best uses for ~jk~ prefixes is to go to common directories as defined above

#+begin_src shell
alias jkl="cd $git_dir"
alias jkgo="cd $org_dir"
alias jkge="cd $emacs_dir"
alias jkgc="cd $conf_dir"
#+end_src

* Usage and Implementation
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       a1abb459-a75d-4f9c-a592-1a2d0281554a
:END:
To simplify setup and get started execute ~general.sh~ which then calls ~aliases.sh~ and ~functions.sh~

For the most part this gets implemented as a submodule as can be seen in my [[https://github.com/andanao/dotfiles/tree/main][dotfiles]] for machines where I mantain dotfile configs
