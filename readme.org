#+title:Shell Globals
In an attempt to stay sane and have similar enough configs across the various computers I use this is intended to be a general top level list of generic aliases and functions.
* Usage and Implementation

:END:
To simplify setup and get started execute ~general.sh~ which then calls ~aliases.sh~ and ~functions.sh~

For the most part this gets implemented as a submodule as can be seen in my [[https://github.com/andanao/dotfiles/tree/main][dotfiles]] for machines where I mantain dotfile configs

* Quick Setup

For use on a server or something where I just want to be able to feel at home

#+begin_src shell
git clone https://github.com/andanao/dotfiles/tree/main
. ./shell_global/general.sh
#+end_src


Oneliner:
#+begin_src shell
git clone https://github.com/andanao/dotfiles/tree/main && . ./shell_global/general.sh
#+end_src
